#  Section 2: Essay B
            My choice of civilization would be the Minoans. From what I have studied the Minoans were the most leisurely
        of the civilizations. Their housing had open rooftops and connected corridors. The courtyard was the center of 
        attention rather than temples or prayer sites. They viewed their women as equals which I definetly respect.
         Not to mention the location, being based on the island of Crete served as a natrual military defense.

            I hold an affinity with the Ancient Egyptians. I feel the Egyptians were under appreciated in this course.
        From what I have read, the term slavery was unduely cast on the Egyptians when it was more of an indentured servitude.
        With slavery being such a touchy subject, I would have objectively looked at each civilization's methods of slavey and 
        compare and contrast them at the end of each section.
