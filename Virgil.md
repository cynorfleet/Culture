### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story starts with a brief bacground as to why the hero Aeneas happened upon Italy. The narrator refers to Lavinian (the land to which Aeneas whould call his new home) as our western shore. This tells me the narrator was present during Aeneas's arrival. It seems that our hero faced a tuff voyage on his way over. Apparently Juno, the Roman version of Hera, didnt like the Trojans too much as see in this excerpt:

    "... A fugetive, this captain, buffeted
    Cruelly on land as on the sea
    By blows from powers of the air - behind them
    Baleful Juno in her sleepless rage."

###  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next the narrator describes of a prophacy that a Trojan born dude would overthrow all to which Juno holds dear, princably the city or Carthage. This being a poem and all, Virgil felt it necessary to cram more backstory by referencing a bunch of names of people and places which then had me reffering to the footnotes on the bottom of the page (Fast-foward to book II).

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Book II continues with Aeneas recounting the fall of Troy. When the Trojans went to sack Greece they found the town deserted except a horse statue and a lone greek kid. He describes the Trojan horse as "A horse of timber, tall as a hill, and sheathed its ribs with planking of cut pine." The kid tells them the gods will favor them if they accept the horse into Troy without damaging it. The night of the Trojan return with the horse, a bunch of greeks jump out and burn the town. Aeneas escapes the Greeks and builds the fleet.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apollo tells Aeneas to go the land of his ancestors. On his way he gets cursed by a harpie and gets held up for a while. He then lands on the island of the cyclops. After hearing all this Dido falls in love with him. They get married, Aeneas gets comfortable then Hermes sets Aeneas back on his path to find Rome. Aeneas leaves and Dido, after having sworn she would never love again, sets herself on fire and falls on Aeneas's sword.

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aeneas eventually lands on Sicicaly and holds some games for entertainment. Juno pursuades the women to set fire to their ships so they would stay in Sicially and never find Rome. Jove then sends a storm to put out the fire and Neptune grants them safe passage to Italy.
