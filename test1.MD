In contrast to the more seriousness of Egyptian funerals, the Minoans saw death as something to be celebrated as a joy to life. Many faces can be seen smiling in funeral processions. The bull was a staple of this culture. Their ancient Greek enemies,tried to slander the Minoans by creating the legend of the Minator. This depicted the Minoan king Minus's wife as having sex with a bull and birthing a beastly offspring. This half man half bull creature was locked in a maze by king Minus. This maze was inspired by Minus's palace which was as big as a city and decorated with pictures of bulls. The rooms were all ajoined with openings in the roofs to allow falling water to fill baths. The Minoans did not practice bull fighting but rather bull balancing, in which they would balance themselves on the backs of bulls. The Minoan woman were seen as equals.
